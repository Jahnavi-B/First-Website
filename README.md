The saying goes that "man is dog's best friend". Others find that other pets are also up to the task. The companionship that animals offer is different from human interaction. Human communicate with speech and although this is an advanced form of communication, it has its limitations. Sometimes people struggle to say the right thing when what we really need is to be simply there for each other. Because animals cannot talk they are superior to humans in detecting the feelings of others. A pet may be able to offer a level of companionship that is deeper and more satisfying than human interaction.
