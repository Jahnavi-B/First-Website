        <h2>This is my test website!</h2>
        <em><strong>The saying goes that "man is dog's best friend". 
            Others find that other pets are also up to the task. 
            The companionship that animals offer is different from 
            human interaction. Human communicate with speech and 
            although this is an advanced form of communication, it 
            has its limitations. Sometimes people struggle to say the 
            right thing when what we really need is to be simply 
            there for each other. Because animals cannot talk they 
            are superior to humans in detecting the feelings of others. 
            A pet may be able to offer a level of companionship that 
            is deeper and more satisfying than human interaction.
